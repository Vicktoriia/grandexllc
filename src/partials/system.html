         <p>Different management systems, including quality management systems, are widely used in enterprises and organizations nowadays. The procedure for establishing and effectively using quality management systems is regulated by the system of national standards. At the same time, the approaches to organization and the performance of quality management systems in enterprises depend on the personnel’s training, knowledge and understanding of existing regulations in the field of standardization and technical regulation. The main problems of effective quality management using quality management systems arise from inept application of existing regulations and a formal approach to organization and management of quality management systems. This primarily happens due to lack of involvement of the staff, lack of understanding of the role and responsibility of the process owner. Ensuring the required quality of processes is achieved by hiring competent managers and specialists for the enterprise. This means that human resources are sufficiently prepared, with a quality system of motivation and a high corporate culture. The company has created a system of information support, electronic document management system. In many enterprises, QMS documents are maintained by quality services, which are perceived as units solely responsible for maintaining the quality management system in working condition. Unfortunately, the functions of quality services are often limited to maintaining the QMS documentation in working order. However, all units of the enterprise must have the required documentation for the QMS available and keep the records prescribed by the QMS documents, the employees should know the contents of QMS documentation, have the skills necessary for document management. A formal approach to quality management systems in enterprises means that the resources allocated to maintaining the management system are used inefficiently. The article gives a brief analysis of the specific problems arising in application of quality management systems and the main directions for eliminating non-compliance of systems with the requirements of federal legislation and normative documents in the field of standardization. We have emphasized that the basic principle of building a quality management system in the enterprise should be the adapting the system to the needs of the enterprise while complying with the national standards of the Russian Federation. This paper presents a generalized view of scientists and specialists on actual problems encountered in implementing QMS in enterprises. We have proposed specific practical solutions (recommendations) formed on the basis of practical construction and application of the QMS.</p>

The main aim of the article was to estimate select aspects of knowledge management quality evaluations in contemporary enterprises from theoretical and practical perspectives. Measuring knowledge management is the biggest challenge for both theoreticians and practitioners. The survey was addressed to organizations conducting business activity in Poland. The research was carried out in 2019 in the form of an online survey. For international organizations, the survey was intended for representatives of these companies’ local branches. It has been shown that the factors that most strongly affect the quality of knowledge are directly related to infrastructure and information technology systems (IT systems). The article contributes to managerial practice by pointing out the importance of evaluating knowledge management quality from the process perspective. The article’s originality lies in the contribution to the literature of evaluating knowledge management quality by empirically analyzing it in contemporary enterprises. The results of research in the field involving assessing the quality of knowledge management have shown the need to focus not only on information technology tools (IT tools) related to infrastructure, but also on the processes approach, taking into account the priority role of the employees.</li>

                <li class="system-why__item"> Introduction
The concept of knowledge management is currently perceived by modern organizations as an important element in building a competitive advantage [1,2,3,4,5]. Methods and strategies used until now to gain a competitive edge, such as launching new products and continuously improving processes, are becoming increasingly less effective, given that products and processes are now easier to duplicate. Adaptation to the needs of competitive enterprises through a knowledge-oriented organization management approach is aimed at increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization [6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. The idea is to bring system improved effectiveness across all areas and processes, using to this end a specific set of instruments and tools in a continuous and permanent manner [13].
The fundamental approach to knowledge management is the process approach [3,4,5]. Identification of key knowledge management processes and existing relationships between them is extremely important for proper knowledge management in an enterprise [6]. The literature on the subject distinguishes various approaches to the classification of the most important knowledge management processes [9,11,13]. These processes are multidimensional; they relate to various aspects of knowledge and relate to various levels of analysis. The important area is knowledge quality, which is a vaguely defined concept because of its abundance and variability [14].
However, knowledge is an important resource in contemporary organizations; its effective use will depend, to a large extent, on its quality [15]. Chakrabarti, Arora and Sharma underlined that research on knowledge quality should grow in scope and prominence [16]. In the manuscript we focus on knowledge quality within the knowledge management process in contemporary organizations. A framework is proposed that uses a process approach in knowledge management and checks some aspects of knowledge quality in a detailed process. The main research question was: what are the aspects of evaluating knowledge management quality in contemporary enterprises? The issues were discussed in both theoretical terms, by analyzing the literature, and practical terms, by looking into the results of empirical research studies conducted in 2019.</li>

                <li class="system-why__item"> 2.1. Knowledge Management-Process Approach
Knowledge management is becoming an increasingly popular concept and one that is being eagerly implemented in contemporary enterprises. Companies are starting to recognize the significant resources of both internal and external knowledge that should be used to build a competitive position in the market. On one hand, knowledge management has become a challenge to be faced by modern enterprises, but on the hand, it has served as a springboard for organizational activities [17]. A company’s success is conditional, among other factors, on its ability to use explicit and implicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge has a technical (know-how) and cognitive dimension, consisting of a belief model and perception patterns. It is the source of the company’s future successes, which is why it is so important to reach it and use it [17,18,19].
Organizations that have implemented and consciously used knowledge management concepts have seen a number of benefits resulting from them [12]. Most importantly, these are: improved performance and target-reaching; streamlining of processes and organization-wide adoption of good practices; development of business activity and increase of innovation; and more ease in launching new products and services [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. In addition, there is also: increased adaptation of products/services to customer requirements; better customer and employee satisfaction; increased employee productivity and performance; improved communication and cooperation; and finally, improved trust [28,29]. In what concerns knowledge management in organizations, it is necessary to point out aspects concerning the use of technology and the social elements of knowledge workers and knowledge distribution. Activities related to knowledge management should be carried out in a systematic and cyclical fashion; focus on processes such as the acquisition, transfer, use, identification and creation of knowledge; and be based on linking knowledge management processes with commercial processes. At the same time they cannot be independent, must align with organizational goals, use technology to support processes and bring benefits to the organization [13]. Noteworthy as well are hard elements—systems and tools; and soft elements—organizational culture [30,31,32].
In enterprises centering their activities around knowledge resources, the following aspects of knowledge management can be distinguished: functional, process-oriented, instrumental and institutional [17,33,34,35,36].
One of the proposed solutions for knowledge management is a process approach [33,37]. Under this approach, knowledge management is understood as the entire process of creating, disseminating and using knowledge to achieve organizational goals [37,38,39]. Knowledge management should thus include the complementary processes of creating, collecting, organizing, disseminating, using and exploiting knowledge in the course of business activity. Most often, processes are identified that make up knowledge management, such as identification, acquisition, development, distribution and dissemination, use and preservation [37,38]. An important aspect of the process approach applied to knowledge management is that it enables better operationalization of individual processes [40,41].
In process terms, knowledge management is a normative and disposable proceeding aimed at creating the right conditions that will enable efficient implementation of operational functions, thereby optimizing the main processes related to knowledge, climate, culture, trust, leadership and organizational structure [15,29,42,43,44]. This will then allow employees to focus on developing knowledge, distributing it, acquiring it and using it correctly [45,46].
In the instrumental approach, knowledge management consists of the appropriate selection and use of instruments and tools contributing to the course of major processes involving knowledge at all levels and areas of the organization. The set of instruments is quite extensive, ranging from financial and legal to organizational and technical. These instruments may include: organizational systems, including an incentive, information, monitoring system, etc., plus a number of different tools, such as databases, IT systems and internal communication networks [13,36,47,48].
In the institutional approach, knowledge management includes a system of job positions and employee teams (strategic and operational level of the organization, formal and informal organization) who perform relevant knowledge management functions [17,38,49,50].
Strategic and operational knowledge management perspectives should also be indicated. A knowledge management strategy usually involves one of two approaches: codification or personalization, or a combination of the two. The choice of knowledge management strategy depends on the nature of the processes that take place within the company. When employee intuition and skills are used, personalization is the one that most often works given its reliance on tacit knowledge. Codification, meanwhile, tends to be reserved for standard products [51,52,53]. In the context of the process approach to knowledge management, the question arises: how can one measure knowledge management in order to obtain tangible effects of its use with reference to organizational goals?</li>

                <li class="system-why__item">2.2. Knowledge Management Quality
Evaluation of knowledge management quality and its measures is a recurring problem in the literature. It applies to all aspects of human life [54,55,56,57]. In this respect, the authors agree that the problem of defining quality is invariably an open topic for research and discussion. There is no doubt that each and every quality evaluation comes burdened with a certain degree of subjectivity—hence the necessity, as authors universally agree, to clarify the broad organizational context for knowledge management measurement.
Evaluation of knowledge management quality in the literature [16,58,59] indicates the importance of testing data quality and information quality; knowledge codification; and the exchange of knowledge, experience and intuition between employees and teams, all while taking into account the use of information technology systems. However, the biggest challenge for managers is to determine measures of knowledge quality in a knowledge management system. Knowledge quality has different levels of detail, and depending on the situation, it can be understood as either product readiness, a resource for active use, compliance with requirements or a degree of proximity of excellence [57].
The literature on the subject include research on the quality of a formalized knowledge management system [16,58,59]. According to the Deepankar, Arora and Sharma, it is important to introduce the principle of basic quality management that support knowledge management processes [16]. The authors have created a hierarchical structure of knowledge quality and described its elements and their attributes, and created a valid and reliable instrument to measure the relative importance of the elements. This model has a hierarchical approach to address the dependence relationships of knowledge quality with its elements of inherent (accurate, complete, consistent, current, relevant), contextual (culture, structure, dependence, clarity, responsive) and actionable (useful, accessible, interpretable, volatile, secure) knowledge quality [16]. The research indicated that actionable knowledge quality is the most important area of concentration for business managers in the knowledge management system (KMS). The authors Deepankar, Arora and Sharma underlined that KMS is just a tool to support organizational knowledge processes, especially for explicit knowledge, but on the other hand, organizational knowledge is implicit, context-dependent, difficult to imitate, and noncodified [16].
The very evaluation of knowledge quality is invariably a subjective assessment, as in cases of commercial and other organizations. It is a derivative of the evaluation of employees’ abilities to perform tasks assigned to them. Once again referring to the arguments raised earlier in the paper, perceived knowledge quality can be said to be determined by knowledge management processes occurring in organizations [37,60,61,62,63,64]. Knowledge management processes and cycles consist of subsequent activities undertaken in organizations. These are: the search for knowledge (identification), acquiring knowledge resources necessary for the organization, developing knowledge while adapting it to local conditions, distributing knowledge within the organization and using knowledge effectively. In the literature cited earlier, knowledge preservation is also indicated as an important aspect of the knowledge management process. All these stages constitute a closed management cycle found in a more or less structured way in virtually every organization (Figure 1).</li>
